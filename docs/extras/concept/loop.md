# Irreplaceable Loop

## ⏱️ 5-Second Loop:
Open the app, lift phone → see floating AR posts nearby → curiosity spike.

## ⏳ 5-Minute Loop:
Tap a post, see who left it, react → explore “clones” from similar users → feel part of an invisible society.

## 🕐 5-Hour Loop:
Get notification: “Something just showed up near you…” → revisit → feels like real-time life feed around your city.

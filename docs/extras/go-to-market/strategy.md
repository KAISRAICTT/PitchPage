# GTM Strategy

## Phase 1: Creator-First
- Target under-discovered creators
- Offer geo-viral reach: create once, go viral across clone network

## Phase 2: Reality Developer Gold Rush
- Launch dev SDK
- Let builders create reality-apps for events, meetups, ghost stories, city lore

## Phase 3: Embed Everywhere
- OEM partnerships (pre-installed)
- Low-friction AR web share

## Guerilla Tactics
- For every city, first target popular colleges, schools, cafes, clubs, parks and then expand further.
- Post “strange” or curious posts that suck others in our perception layer.

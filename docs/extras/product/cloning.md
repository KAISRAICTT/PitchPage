# Anchor + Clone Logic

- Posts are *anchored* where created
- If performing well, they’re *cloned* to semantically similar places
- Clones are personalized, random, ephemeral

### Why It Works:
- Feels alive, non-repetitive
- Triggers FOMO and curiosity
- Users explore their own version of reality

### Killer Hooks:
- Same place, different vibe for every user
- Posts decay unless engaged — *like a reality-powered Instagram Story*

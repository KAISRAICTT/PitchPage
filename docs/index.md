# Welcome to HaloH  
The Perception Layer of Reality

## 🧠 Rewiring How Humans Perceive the World

Haloh isn’t just an app.  
It’s a **perception framework** — a new layer of reality that sits between the physical world and the mind.

While legacy social media digitized our 2D identity, Haloh **spatializes social expression**, anchoring digital presence to real-world locations — floating, embedded, and alive.

We are building a **psychologically engineered, technologically orchestrated dimension** that rewires the user’s sensory interaction with places. Every post, object, or vibe becomes a **living annotation of the physical world**, not just a story on a timeline.
